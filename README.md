# EmberJS Seattle Code of Conduct

EmberJS Seattle is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

This code of conduct applies to all EmberJS Seattle spaces, including [Meetup Events](https://www.meetup.com/Ember-js-Seattle-Meetup/) and the [EmberJS Seattle Slack](https://ember-js-seattle.slack.com/), both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the Meetup Organizers.

Some EmberJS Seattle spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

* Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion.
* Sexual images in public spaces.
* Threats of violence.
* Deliberate intimidation.
* Stalking or following.
* Harassing photography or recording.
* Sustained disruption of discussion.
* Inappropriate physical contact.
* Unwelcome sexual attention.
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.

## Reporting

If you are being harassed by a member of EmberJS Seattle, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the Meetup Organizers via the [Meetup website](https://www.meetup.com/Ember-js-Seattle-Meetup/) (on the left sidebar, under "Organizers", click on "Contact"). If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can.

This code of conduct applies to EmberJS Seattle spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of EmberJS Seattle outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by EmberJS Seattle members, especially Meetup Organizers, seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from EmberJS Seattle based on their past behavior, including behavior outside EmberJS Seattle spaces and behavior towards people who are not in EmberJS Seattle.

In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom weâ€™ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of EmberJS Seattle members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

## Consequences

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, Meetup Organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all EmberJS Seattle spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other EmberJS Seattle members or the general public.

## Additional Reading

Please read through the [Ember.js Project Community Guidelines](https://emberjs.com/guidelines/) for a more detailed overview of the intent and goals of the Ember community at large. We stand by the principles of the community CoC and consider them part of our CoC as well.
